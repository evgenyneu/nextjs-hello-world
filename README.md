# Next.js Hello World Benchmark

This is a simple Next.js (JavaScript) web app that returns "Hello, World!" response, made for benchmarking performance and resource usage and comparing it with [Axum (Rust)](https://github.com/evgenyneu/axum-hello-world) benchmark.

## Build

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

Run:

```sh
node .next/standalone/server.js
```


## Deploy

```sh
ssh lorange "mkdir -p ~/nextjs-hello-world"
scp -r .next/standalone/. lorange:~/nextjs-hello-world/
scp cluster.js lorange:~/nextjs-hello-world/
```

Open deployment directory:

```sh
ssh lorange
cd ~/nextjs-hello-world
```

Run with one node process:

```sh
node server.js
```

Run with clustering (utilize all CPU cores):

```sh
node cluster.js
```

## Benchmarking


### Before (after reboot)

* RAM usage: 237M
* CPU Load average (over 1 minute): 0.06

### Server running idle

* Single node process: `node server.js`:

* RAM usage: 271M
* CPU Load average (over 1 minute): 0.02

Clustering (utilize all CPU cores): `node cluster.js`:

* RAM usage: 535M
* CPU Load average (over 1 minute): 0.07

### Stress test #1

With one node process: `node server.js`

```sh
wrk -t10 -c1000 -d600s http://192.168.20.25:3000/
```

* RAM usage: 464M
* CPU Load average (over 5 minutes): 0.99

## Hardware

The web server was run on Orange Pi 5 Max with 16 GB RAM and 1 TB NVMe SSD running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Node.js v22.12.0. The `wrk` benchmark command was run on a Desktop PC (12600K, 32 GB RAM), running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Both machines were connected to NetComm NF18ACV router via 1 Gbps Ethernet cables.
